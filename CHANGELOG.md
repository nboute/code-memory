## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-08

Release theme: **Watcher consolidation + daemon resource-leak fixes — single OS autostart, multi-root registry**.

### Added

**`code-memory watchd` — single long-lived multi-root watch daemon.** Replaces the
per-repo OS autostart units (one launchd job per repo on macOS, one systemd unit
per repo on Linux, etc.) with a single always-on daemon that watches all registered
repos in one process. `watchd --status` reports the daemon's PID and all watched roots.

**Watch registry at `~/.config/code-memory/watch-registry.json`.** Maps project path
to slug for the daemon to discover and watch all registered repos. Registry supports
atomic writes and advisory file locking; the daemon live-reconciles as repos are
added/removed via `ensure_autostart`, so no manual daemon restart is needed.

**`code-memory autostart migrate` command.** Consolidates legacy per-repo autostart
units (launchd jobs, systemd units, schtasks entries) into the single `watchd` daemon.
The migration seeds the watch registry from existing roots, verifies the daemon covers
all registered projects, and only then removes the old per-repo units — guarantees
no repo is left unwatched. Supports `--dry-run` to preview changes.

Reason: reduce macOS login-item clutter from N watcher jobs to one, prevent systemd
unit explosion on Linux servers, and guarantee zero memory/FD growth in the always-on
daemon by centralizing resource lifecycle.

### Changed

**Autostart now installs ONE fixed unit instead of N (one per repo).** On macOS,
the legacy login item per repo (`com.codememory.watch.<slug>`) collapses to one
fixed entry (`com.codememory.watchd`); on Linux, one systemd user unit
(`codememory-watchd.service`) replaces `codememory-watch-<slug>.service` instances;
on Windows, one schtasks entry (`CodeMemory\Watchd`) replaces per-project entries.
`ensure_autostart` now registers repos into the watch registry and ensures the single
daemon is running; a legacy per-repo-unit sweep is retained for one to two releases
to clean up old entries.

**MCP server boot now registers the active repo with the daemon and starts an
in-process fallback watcher only when the daemon does not already cover that repo.**
Prevents double-syncing (daemon + in-process watcher both queuing the same ingest)
and reduces startup noise in logs.

Reason: simplify the autostart surface (one fixed entry per machine instead of
scaling with repo count) and prevent index double-writes.

### Fixed

**Eliminated per-sync resource leaks in the long-lived daemon.** The daemon now
holds Qdrant and FalkorDB clients as process-singletons instead of creating fresh
connections per sync; `Pipeline` is a context manager and its sqlite connections
(episodic metadata + ingest state) are opened and closed per `sync_repo` call,
fixing both a connection leak and a silent cross-thread `sqlite3.ProgrammingError`
that would fail every ingest after the first in daemon mode; the full-ingest thread
pool is always shut down via try/finally (previously leaked threads on exception);
embedder initialization is now lock-guarded against a cold-start race; and
same-project syncs are serialized via single-flight to prevent concurrent ingests
of the same repo.

Reason: the daemon runs 24/7 — any leak (open file descriptor, unclosed connection,
spawned thread) accumulates until the machine runs out of resources. This fix is
critical for production use.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-07

Release theme: **Gemma removed — claims are now agent-authored via `codememory_assert_claim` only**.

### Removed

**Gemma2:9b LLM dependency removed entirely.** The `ClaimExtractor` class, the
`code-memory extract-claims` CLI command, and the `codememory_extract_claims` MCP
tool are all gone. No local Ollama model is required for claim extraction
anymore.

**OpenCode plugin no longer auto-fires `extractClaimsDetached`** on session idle.
The Claude Code plugin was already clean.

**Installers no longer pull gemma2:9b.** `install.sh`, `scripts/install.sh`, and
`.env.example` have been updated to reflect the agent-authored approach.

### Changed

**Claims are now agent-authored exclusively.** The `codememory_assert_claim` MCP
tool is the sole claim creation path. Plugins detect durable user assertions via
regex heuristic (claim-intent) and nudge the agent to call the tool — no LLM is
in the loop at any point. This eliminates a ~5.4 GB model download and ~30s
inference latency per session.

**Config defaults updated.** `CLAIMS_EXTRACTION` flag still exists but gates only
claim storage (it no longer controls LLM model invocation). `CLAIMS_LLM_MODEL`
env var removed.

**Update plan no longer checks for gemma2:9b** in `code-memory update` component
listing. Only `bge-m3` is tracked as the Ollama model dependency.

**Documentation updated.** README, install scripts, plugin SKILL.md, and
`.env.example` all reflect the gemma-free, agent-authored claim workflow.

Reason: gemma2:9b auto-extraction produced noisy/empty triples on most prompts
and the agent-powered `codememory_assert_claim` path (regex claim-intent +
agent-authored triples) provides higher-quality claims with zero model
dependency.

## [0.7.6] — 2026-06-21

Release theme: **Correct tree-sitter pin + Windows console & extras fixes**.

### Fixed

**tree-sitter-language-pack pinned to `==1.8.1`** (was `==1.0.0` in the broken 0.7.5).
Version 1.0.0 has no bundled language grammars (it uses a download model), so
`get_language('csharp')` raised `LanguageNotFoundError` and extraction produced
zero symbols on every platform. Version 1.9.1 is also broken (raises `'bytes'
object is not an instance of 'str'` even on macOS — a 1.9.x regression). 1.8.1
is the last known-good release with bundled grammars; the original Windows
failure was caused by the loose `>=0.7` floor letting fresh installs float to
1.9.1.

Reason: stop floating into broken 1.9.x and restore symbol extraction everywhere.

**Windows console crash in `code-memory update`**: stdout/stderr are now forced
to UTF-8 (`errors="replace"`) at the CLI and MCP entry points, so Unicode
status glyphs (→, •, ✓) no longer raise `UnicodeEncodeError` on cp1252
PowerShell consoles.

Reason: the updater crashed before doing any work on non-UTF-8 Windows terminals.

### Added

**Optional-extras selection prompt** in `code-memory update` and the install
one-liner (`install.sh` / `install.ps1`): users are now asked which optional
extras to enable (`dotnet` for .NET assembly indexing, `hybrid` for in-process
BGE-M3). TTY-gated with a `CODEMEMORY_EXTRAS` env override and an `--extras`
flag; non-interactive runs install nothing new. Also fixes the bash installer
gating the prompt on `[ -t 0 ]`, which was always false under `curl | bash` so
the prompt never appeared.

Reason: previously there was no way to opt into .NET indexing during update/install.

## [0.7.5] — 2026-06-21

Release theme: **Windows ingest fix — pin tree-sitter-language-pack**.

**⚠️ Superseded by 0.7.6 — this release pinned tree-sitter-language-pack==1.0.0 which broke extraction (no bundled grammars). Do not use.**

### Fixed

**What:** pinned `tree-sitter-language-pack` to `==1.0.0` (was `>=0.7`).
Version 1.9.1 (and other releases > 1.0.0) ship a broken Windows wheel:
`get_language()` returns a `builtins.Language` that core `tree-sitter`
rejects (`TypeError: __init__() argument 1 must be tree_sitter.Language,
not builtins.Language`), surfacing during ingest as `'bytes' object is
not an instance of 'str'`. This broke `code-memory` CLI ingest on Windows
across all install environments (uv-tool, global Python, watch daemon).

**Reason:** the loose `>=0.7` floor allowed the broken 1.9.1 wheel to
resolve on fresh Windows installs; pinning to the known-good 1.0.0
restores ingest. The pin lives in wheel metadata so every install path
resolves to the working version.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-12

Release theme: **Worktree resilience, atomic graph rebuilds, and fresh
indexes**. The index now survives interrupted full ingests; linked git
worktrees reuse the main repo's index instead of forcing a cold re-ingest;
and queries trigger non-blocking background rebuilds when the index drifts
from HEAD.

### Added — Linked git worktree awareness

**What:** a new `_git_toplevel()` helper resolves linked git worktrees
to the main repo's root by running `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`
after the baseline `--show-toplevel` call. In a linked worktree, the
two paths differ; in the main worktree, they're the same. The project
slug is now derived from the main repo's directory name, so all worktrees
of the same project reuse the same Qdrant / Falkor namespace without
requiring a cold re-ingest.

**Reason:** developers working in linked worktrees (e.g. `git worktree add
../feature-branch`) saw no code-memory functionality because the ingest
system minted a separate Qdrant collection and Falkor graph for each
worktree. A single repo with 3–5 active worktrees accumulated 3–5 cold
ingests. The main repo and each worktree now share the same index.

### Added — Non-persistent autostart for linked worktrees

**What:** two new gates in the autostart system:

- `is_linked_git_worktree(path)` — checks whether *path* is inside a
  linked worktree via git CLI.
- `is_non_persistent_watch_dir(path)` — returns True for ephemeral
  session dirs OR linked worktrees; used by `ensure_autostart()` to skip
  registering a persistent OS agent for directories that are temporary or
  share the main repo's watcher.
- `LaunchdAdapter.prune_stale()` (run on every MCP bootstrap) removes
  launchd agents whose `WorkingDirectory` is gone or is a linked worktree.

**Reason:** the prior release fixed the watcher's per-session accumulation;
this release prevents the same bleed on linked worktrees. A developer with
2 linked worktrees no longer gets 3 persistent `code-memory watch` units.

### Added — Shadow-graph atomic promotion (graph durability fix)

**What:** the full ingest pipeline now builds into a shadow FalkorDB
graph named `<project_graph>__shadow` and atomically promotes it only
after the rebuild succeeds:

1. At ingest start, drop any leftover shadow from a prior interrupted
   rebuild.
2. Redirect all graph writes to the shadow FalkorStore instance.
3. On successful completion, execute `GRAPH.DELETE <live>`, then
   `GRAPH.COPY <shadow> <live>`, then `GRAPH.DELETE <shadow>`.
4. If the copy fails, the live graph is cleared but the shadow stays
   intact — the caller can retry without losing data.

**Reason:** before this, an interrupted full ingest (network loss,
Ollama timeout, Falkor down, user kills the process) left the live
graph empty so subsequent `callers` / `definitions` / `callees` queries
returned nothing until a manual full re-ingest. The graph now survives
interruption — the shadow is cleaned up on the next rebuild attempt.

### Added — Health-check guard for stale rebuilds

**What:** the ingest state now records `file_count` and `symbol_count`
from each successful full rebuild. Before starting an incremental ingest,
`_health_check_ok()` compares the current ingestable file count against
the stored baseline; if it grew more than 20% and the graph symbol count
is suspiciously low (below a ratio threshold), a full rebuild is forced
with a diagnostic message to stderr.

Config:
- `CODE_MEMORY_INGEST_HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED` (default `true`)
- `CODE_MEMORY_INGEST_HEALTH_CHECK_MIN_RATIO` (default `0.3` = expect ≥30%
  of file count as symbol count)

**Reason:** a transient FalkorDB outage or an incomplete prior ingest
could leave the graph permanently empty while incremental ingests reported
success. The health check detects this silently-failed state and forces a
rebuild, with no user intervention needed.

### Added — Single-flight ingest lock

**What:** new `src/code_memory/sync/single_flight.py` module provides
in-process (`asyncio.Lock`) + cross-process (PID file) guards to prevent
concurrent full ingests for the same (root, project) pair.

- `try_acquire(root, project)` — returns True if no rebuild is running,
  False if the slot is taken.
- `release(root, project)` — releases the slot unconditionally.
- Stale PID files (dead process or age > 30 min) are silently removed.

The Claude Code and Cursor plugins' `on-session-start.js` fast-path-skip a
spawn when a live ingest is detected, preventing thundering-herd `code-memory
ingest` calls on boot.

**Reason:** on slow machines or large repos, overlapping `code-memory ingest`
calls could queue up and queue up (especially if the embedder is I/O-bound),
causing a session to take 5+ minutes to boot. The lock ensures at most one
rebuild runs; fast-path skips spare the overhead.

### Added — Ingest safety guards

**What:** new `assert_safe_ingest_root()` function in `sync/safety.py`
refuses to ingest:

1. System/HOME roots (same set as the watcher guard: HOME, /, /tmp,
   /var, /etc, /usr, /System, /Library, /opt, /Applications, C:/, etc.)
2. Non-git directories (checked via `is_inside_git_worktree()`).

Bypass via `CODE_MEMORY_UNSAFE_INGEST=1` env var (env-only, not a CLI
flag, to prevent accidental use).

**Reason:** `code-memory ingest ~` could walk every IDE cache, checkout,
and node_modules on disk. `ingest` is more dangerous than `watch` because
it stores results; a non-git directory ingest mints an arbitrary project
slug. The guard is invoked by the CLI `ingest` entry point and by hooks.

### Added — IPv4-default service URLs

**What:** the default `OLLAMA_URL`, `QDRANT_URL`, and `FALKOR_URL` now
use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`. This works around a Windows
quirk where `localhost` may resolve to `::1` (IPv6) and hang on socket
connect.

Config example (all in `.code-memoryrc` or env):
```
OLLAMA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
QDRANT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6333
FALKOR_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379
```

**Reason:** on some Windows setups, the TCP stack prefers IPv6 and
binds localhost to `::1`, while the service listens on `127.0.0.1`.
Callers then hang waiting for a timeout (seconds to minutes). Using
the explicit IPv4 address is more reliable.

### Added — Non-blocking `_ensure_fresh` for MCP queries

**What:** the pre-query guard `_ensure_fresh()` no longer blocks on a
sync. Instead:

1. Spawn a quick freshness check (`_is_index_stale()`) in a bounded
   daemon thread (`_FRESHNESS_PROBE_TIMEOUT`, default 2.0 s).
2. If the index is stale AND the check finished in time, fire a
   background `_background_rebuild()` in a detached daemon thread
   protected by the single-flight lock.
3. Return immediately so the query gets the current (possibly stale)
   index while the rebuild runs in the background.

**Reason:** MCP queries were blocking on a full ingest in the worst case,
causing Claude Code / OpenCode / Cursor to hang for minutes. Now the agent
gets an answer immediately while background sync keeps the index fresh.

### Fixed — Ollama embed connect timeout

**What:** `OllamaEmbedder` now uses split connect/read timeouts:

- `_DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 5.0 s` — fail fast on wrong stack (IPv6
  vs IPv4) or misconfigured host.
- `_DEFAULT_READ_TIMEOUT = 300.0 s` — Ollama's cold-load model phase
  happens during read, not connect.

Configurable via `OLLAMA_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` and `OLLAMA_READ_TIMEOUT`
env vars.

**Reason:** the old single `timeout=300` param applied to connect, which
could hang for 300 s waiting on a misconfigured IPv6 address. A 5 s
connect timeout with 3 retries fails fast (~15 s worst case) instead.

### Added — Vibe plugin

**What:** new `plugins/vibe/` brings code-memory to Mistral Vibe. Vibe
lacks lifecycle hooks (unlike Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode), so the
plugin delivers:

- **Skill** (`/code-memory`) with orientation guidance and manual command
  runner.
- **MCP server** registration in `config.toml`.
- **OS autostart watcher** for file-edit → auto-reingest (since hooks
  aren't available).

Install: `./plugins/vibe/install.sh` (default user scope, with flags for
project scope, no-mcp, no-watch, uninstall).

**Reason:** Vibe is a code-aware LLM editor with a different extension
model. Bundling the same code-memory integration surfaces our topology
queries to Vibe users without reimplementation.

### Added — Ingest state enhancements

**What:** the ingest state now stores:

- `file_count` / `symbol_count` from each full rebuild (used by the
  health check).
- `file_count` and `symbol_count` are populated by the pipeline during
  ingest and read by the health-check predicate before deciding to
  rebuild.

**Reason:** enables the health-check guard to detect silently-failed
ingests.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-04

Release theme: **Dart joins the graph, and `this.field.method()` resolves
across languages**. The extractor gains a ninth language and the
receiver-type tier — previously TypeScript-only — now narrows method
calls in C#, PHP, and Dart too.

### Added — Dart / Flutter language support

**What:** `.dart` files are now parsed. Symbols cover classes, mixins,
enums, extensions, typedefs, top-level functions, methods,
getters/setters, and constructors (with parameter arity); imports and
re-exports surface their URI (`package:…`, `dart:…`, relative); calls and
type references (inheritance, field/parameter/return types, generic
arguments) are extracted. Dart's grammar differs structurally from the
other languages — function names follow the return type inside
`function_signature`, calls are a `selector` + `argument_part` chain
rather than a single call-expression node, and import URIs are nested
under `configurable_uri > uri` — so each needed dedicated handling.
Node-type names that collide with TypeScript (`function_signature`,
`declaration`, …) are gated on `lang == "dart"` so TS output is
unchanged.

**Reason:** Flutter/Dart codebases were a blind spot — every `.dart`
file was skipped at `lang_for`, so half of a mobile + backend stack had
no graph topology, leaving retrieval to dense vectors alone.

### Added — Cross-language receiver-type inference (C#, PHP, Dart)

**What:** the `this.<field>.<method>()` narrowing that let the resolver
disambiguate a call against the methods of the field's declared type now
works beyond TypeScript. The class-scope stack is language-aware: C#
reads fields, properties, and C# 12 primary-constructor parameters and
resolves both `_repo.Get()` and `this.Bar.Save()`; PHP reads properties
and PHP 8 constructor promotion and resolves `$this->repo->m()`; Dart
reads typed fields and resolves `repo.m()` / `this.repo.m()`. A shared
`_bare_type_name` reduces qualified / generic / nullable types to the
bare identifier the resolver matches on, dropping primitives.

**Reason:** the resolver's receiver tier is language-agnostic — it
matches a bare type name against files defining that symbol — but the
extractor only ever emitted `receiver_type` for TS. On C#/PHP/Dart, a
method call like `byId` collapsed to a bare identifier that the resolver
could never narrow against the dozens of same-named methods elsewhere in
the codebase. Emitting the inferred receiver type fixes that with no
resolver changes.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-06-04

Release theme: **git operations never block on credentials**. The
snapshot store talked to `origin` with plain `git fetch` / `git push`
and nothing to suppress interactive auth. On any HTTPS remote without
cached credentials that froze the MCP server at boot and re-prompted on
every `code-memory status` and watcher tick.

### Fixed — Interactive git credential prompts froze the MCP server

**What:** every best-effort / read git call in `SnapshotStore` (`fetch`,
listing, the snapshot existence check) now runs with
`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `GIT_SSH_COMMAND=ssh -oBatchMode=yes`, and an
empty `-c credential.helper=` so it fails fast instead of blocking. Only
the explicit publish path (`push` during `snapshot publish` / `gc`) opts
back into credentials via `allow_credentials=True`, so opted-in remotes
still authenticate.

**Reason:** `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` alone was not enough — a configured
credential helper such as Git Credential Manager is a separate program
git still launches, and it pops its own dialog. The MCP bootstrap runs a
synchronous `sync_repo(trigger="mcp-boot")` with `fetch=True`; on an
auth-required remote that `git fetch` hung waiting for a password the
stdio server could never supply, so OpenCode reported the server as not
running. The watcher's per-quiet-period sync and `code-memory status`
hit the same wall. Resetting the helper list makes git return in ~0.1s
(no remote snapshots) instead of waiting on a human.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-05-30

Release theme: **the watcher stops leaking**. A diagnosis of runaway RAM
turned up dozens of orphaned `code-memory watch` daemons — one permanent
launchd agent per directory any MCP server had ever booted in, including
throwaway per-session dirs. This release stops the bleed and self-heals
the cruft. Also lands semantic dedupe for near-duplicate user claims.

### Fixed — Unbounded launchd watcher accumulation

**What:** `ensure_autostart()` no longer registers a persistent OS agent
for ephemeral / per-session directories (`~/.claude/homunculus/*`,
`.cursor/worktrees/*`, `plugins/cache/*`); the session-scoped in-process
watcher still covers them. `LaunchdAdapter.prune_stale()` (run on every
MCP bootstrap) boots out and removes agents whose `WorkingDirectory` is
gone or ephemeral.

**Reason:** each MCP boot registered a `KeepAlive` + `RunAtLoad` agent for
its cwd. Ephemeral session dirs got permanent watchers that survived kill
(launchd relaunched them) and reboot, piling up dozens of daemons and the
RAM/CPU they pin. `prune_stale` is launchd-only for now; systemd/schtasks
GC is a follow-up.

### Fixed — Graceful watcher teardown on MCP shutdown

**What:** the MCP server registers `atexit` + `SIGTERM` handlers that call
`Watcher.stop()`.

**Reason:** the in-process watcher ran as a daemon thread with no clean
stop, so an in-flight debounced sync was dropped and the watchdog Observer
never joined cleanly on exit.

### Added — Semantic dedupe of near-duplicate claims

**What:** `ClaimsIndexer` collapses a new claim into the closest open claim
when cosine similarity is `>= CLAIMS_SEMANTIC_DEDUP_THRESHOLD` (default
0.90), ahead of the SQL write.

**Reason:** exact (subject, predicate, object) dedupe missed paraphrases
("project uses flurryx" / "project depends-on flurryx"), so semantically
identical claims were stored three times. Best-effort — embedder/backend
errors fall through to the existing SQL-level dedupe; set `>= 1.0` to
disable.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-26

Release theme: **the claim loop closes**. v0.2.0 shipped the storage
side of user claims (bi-temporal SQLite + Graphiti-style extraction).
This release ships everything around it — detection at prompt time,
agent-authored assertion via MCP, dedupe at write time, plus a hard
fix for the silent-hook bug that meant the whole feature was off by
default. Also lands the Angular clean-arch resolution work: TS
abstract classes + receiver-type inference + DI graph queries.

### Added — Plugin claim-intent detection (Claude Code + OpenCode)

**What:** every user prompt is scanned for durable-assertion patterns
(preferences, decisions, rejections, ownership, location). When a
match fires, both plugins inject a polarity-flipped nudge into the
agent's system prompt **before** the agent sees the message:

```
[code-memory] Durable user assertion detected — ACT BEFORE ANSWERING.
…
DEFAULT ACTION: call codememory_assert_claim NOW, in the same response,
BEFORE any other tool call or user-facing text.
…
DO NOT skip because: the fact is already in CLAUDE.md / the wording is
emotional / the user is also asking a question / you are not sure of
the scope.
SKIP ONLY if ALL of these hold: hypothetical, counterfactual, retracted,
or a higher-confidence dupe was asserted in this session.
If you skip, state ONE LINE: "skipped claim: <reason>". Silent skips
are a bug.
```

- Claude Code: `plugins/claude-code/scripts/lib/claim-intent.js` +
  injection via `UserPromptSubmit` → `additionalContext`.
- OpenCode: `plugins/opencode/src/code-memory-lib/claim-intent.ts` +
  injection via `chat.message` → `experimental.chat.system.transform`.
- Patterns and nudge template are kept lockstep across the two plugins;
  21 CC tests + 18 OpenCode tests pin the regex behavior, the pure-
  question filter, and the formatted template text.

**Reason:** the v0.2.0 extractor only fired post-turn from `session.idle`
via Ollama, so a user typing "I love Clean Architecture" produced no
claim if the agent didn't think to call `codememory_assert_claim`
itself. Polarity-flipped wording + explicit anti-rationalizations
move the default from "skip" to "assert", and the mandatory "skipped
claim: <reason>" line makes silent drops detectable in the transcript.

### Added — Agent-authored claims via MCP

**What:** `codememory_assert_claim(subject, predicate, object, project, …)`
MCP tool lets the agent register a claim directly without invoking the
extractor LLM. Predicate is canonicalized to lowercase-kebab so
single-valued-predicate contradiction handling (e.g. "uses → switches
DB") still works. Bypasses the `CLAIMS_EXTRACTION` flag (no Ollama
in the loop). Entity resolution runs if the resolver is wired up,
otherwise the row stores raw strings.

**Reason:** matches the plugin nudge above. The agent now has a
first-party tool to call when the nudge fires; the extractor remains
available for cases where claims need to be pulled out of historical
prompts post-hoc.

### Added — Claims store dedupe at write time

**What:** `ClaimsStore.upsert` looks for an open row matching
`(subject, predicate, object, polarity)` and refreshes it in place
instead of inserting a duplicate:

- `confidence` is monotonic non-decreasing (`MAX(prev, new)`).
- Non-empty `evidence_span` overwrites a blank one; never the reverse.
- `recorded_at` advances.
- `session_id`, `source_prompt_id`, `entity_*` keep the FIRST
  observation's provenance via `COALESCE`.
- Polarity flips and different-object assertions still go through the
  bi-temporal close path (`valid_to` set on the prior row).

**Reason:** the new "ACT BEFORE ANSWERING" nudge caused the agent to
re-assert the same claim every turn it qualified, bloating `claims.db`
with identical rows. Dedupe at write keeps the audit trail useful
without losing the bi-temporal semantics — `current()` still returns
exactly one row per (s,p,o,polarity), `as_of()` queries still see the
right history.

### Fixed — Claude Code plugin install actually enables the plugin

**What:** the previous `plugins/claude-code/install.sh` only symlinked
the repo into `~/.claude/plugins/code-memory/`. Claude Code ignores
that path — its plugin loader reads only
`~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (marketplace-installed
plugins). Result: `hooks.json` was on disk but no hooks fired. The
hooks panel in Claude Code correctly reported "No hooks configured for
UserPromptSubmit" — the user just had no way to know symlinking
wasn't enough.

The fix:

- New marketplace manifest at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the
  repo root, pointing at `./plugins/claude-code`.
- `install.sh` rewritten: validates both manifests, runs
  `claude plugin marketplace add <repo>`, runs
  `claude plugin install code-memory@code-memory`, then registers the
  MCP server as before. Idempotent (uninstall+reinstall on re-run).
- `plugins/claude-code/README.md` updated; main README documents the
  marketplace step and warns against bare-symlink installs.

**Reason:** the whole plugin was off by default for every user who
followed the documented install. Plugins not registered with the CC
loader are inert no matter what's on disk.

### Added — TypeScript abstract class + receiver-type inference

**What:** the tree-sitter extractor now recognizes
`abstract_class_declaration` / `abstract_method_signature` as symbol
nodes, and `Call` carries an optional `receiver_type` field inferred
from `this.<field>.<method>()` where the field's type is readable
from a member initializer or annotation.

**Reason:** Angular clean-arch use cases call their port via
`this.port.method()` where `port` is `inject(SomeAbstractPort)`. Without
abstract-class recognition the port never enters the graph; without
receiver-type inference the resolver can't narrow `method()` to the
port's overloads, so every Angular use case looks like an orphan call.
The pattern is widespread enough in modern Angular codebases that
losing it bricks topology queries on the most common architectural
shape.

### Added — DI graph queries (`codememory_injects`, `codememory_injectors`)

**What:** two new MCP tools matching the existing `callers` / `callees`
shape, but operating on DI injection edges:

- `codememory_injects(symbol)` — what tokens does this file inject?
- `codememory_injectors(token)` — which files inject this token?

**Reason:** in clean-arch / hexagonal projects the DI graph carries
nearly as much architectural signal as the call graph. Surfacing it as
a first-class topology query closes one of the gaps the v0.2.0
codebase-exploration rule called out.

### Added — Layered config via `.code-memoryrc`

**What:** `code_memory.config` now reads `KEY=VALUE` overrides from
`./.code-memoryrc` (project-local) and `~/.config/code-memory/config`
(global). Real shell env wins; project file beats global file.

**Reason:** users were embedding env exports into shell rc files just
to pin one default per project (e.g. `CODE_MEMORY_PROJECT=auto`).
Layered config files keep those defaults out of the shell environment
and make per-project overrides commitable when desired.

### Added — Tests

- `tests/test_extractor_ts_abstract.py` — abstract-class symbol pickup.
- `tests/test_extractor_ts_inject.py` — `inject()` call extraction.
- `tests/test_extractor_receiver_type.py` — receiver-type inference.
- `tests/test_mcp_assert_claim.py` — MCP tool happy path + invalid
  inputs + canonicalization + entity resolution.
- `tests/test_claim_store.py` — 5 new dedupe tests covering same-fact
  reupsert, max-confidence, non-empty-evidence wins, first-session-id
  preservation, polarity-differs-not-dedupe.

Total: **496 passed, 3 skipped** (Python), **21 CC + 18 OpenCode**
plugin tests pass.



Release theme: **enterprise-grade ingest, full features, no quality
tradeoffs**. The bulk of this release attacks the cold-ingest problem
on large repos and the precision gaps in topology queries. Honest
framing throughout — every speedup keeps `bge-m3` recall intact;
every limit is documented.

### Added — `Snapshots: ingest once, sync everywhere`

**What:** an end-to-end fix + headline workflow for the cold-ingest
problem.

- `code-memory snapshot publish` builds a tar.gz containing every
  Qdrant vector (with hybrid dense + sparse), every Falkor node and
  edge, the ingest state pointer, and a SHA-256-digested manifest;
  pushes it to a dedicated git branch (default
  `codemem-snapshots`). Distribution channel is just git.
- `code-memory sync` after a `git pull` auto-detects whether a
  snapshot exists for HEAD, a recent ancestor, or neither — and
  pulls + applies the snapshot, or applies the ancestor + runs the
  delta, or falls back to a full ingest. Verified end-to-end:
  cold-ingest → publish → wipe → sync restores `retrieve` /
  `callers` / `definitions` / `importers` in 0.5 s (snapshot
  matches HEAD) or 0.9 s (HEAD one commit ahead).

**Reason:** `bge-m3` on Apple Silicon Metal is hardware-bound at
~21 chunks/sec — a 17k-file monorepo takes ~2 h cold no matter how
clever the pipeline gets. The real fix is to never run the embedder
on slow machines: build the index once on a fast host (CI / GPU box),
publish, sync everywhere else. The cold-ingest cost moves from
"every dev on every clone" to "once per merge in CI".

### Fixed — Snapshot hybrid-vector round-trip

**What:** `_dump_vectors` used `list(p.vector)` which silently returns
the dict's keys when Qdrant returns the hybrid layout. Snapshots
looked valid (right manifest, right counts) but every vector blob
carried the literal string `["dense"]` instead of the embedding.
Apply then crashed in `QdrantStore.upsert` accessing `vector.dense`
on a list of slot names.

New `_normalize_vector_for_dump(vec)` coerces both the hybrid dict
and legacy bare-list layouts into one canonical JSON shape; new
`_hybridvec_from_dump(payload)` is the reverse on apply. Backward
compat: snapshots written with the bare-list shape still load.

**Reason:** the snapshot feature was non-functional in shipping code.
Format-only tests round-tripped JSON correctly, but no test
exercised the actual Qdrant → snapshot → Qdrant path. Added 8 new
tests in `tests/test_snapshot_e2e.py` (6 pure-format, 2 live against
real Falkor + Qdrant) to keep the regression dead.

### Added — `REFERENCES` edge type for C# type-position usage

**What:** the graph extractor now emits a new `REFERENCES` edge for
every type-position usage of a symbol — base lists (`class X : IFoo`),
parameter types, field/property types, generic args, type
constraints, cast / is / as / typeof. `callers` queries union
`CALLS | REFERENCES` so an interface like `IFooService` returns both
the call sites of its members and the files that declare it as a
dependency.

**Reason:** `code-memory callers IFoo` on a C# repo used to return
0 because the graph only modeled call expressions. Implementations,
parameter-type users, and generic-arg sites were invisible — the
single biggest precision gap on .NET corpora. Verified end-to-end
on a fresh C# project: `callers IDocumentServiceBase` (renamed
to `IFooService` in tests) now surfaces the impl class **and**
every consumer that declares the interface as a constructor or
field type.

### Added — Canonical import aliasing for Python relative imports

**What:** two fixes that close the import-precision gap.

1. Extractor: `_import_module` now reads the `module_name` field on
   `import_from_statement` instead of the first matching `dotted_name`
   child. Without this, `from ..pkg.sub import Sym` stored `Sym`
   (the imported name) as the module key — every relative import in
   the project was filed under the wrong slot.
2. Resolver: for each relative import that resolves to a project
   file, derive the canonical dotted-module name by climbing
   `__init__.py` parents and emit alias `IMPORTS` edges. Also taught
   `_resolve_relative_import` to handle Python dotted-relative form
   (`..pkg.sub.leaf`), not just TS/JS path-style. New
   `import_aliases_added` stat on `ResolverStats`.

**Reason:** before this, `code-memory importers code_memory.graph.falkor_store`
on this very repo returned 2 (only the test files using the absolute
form) when the actual answer was 6 (4 source files use relative
imports). After the fix: 6 true positives, 0 false positives —
strictly more precise than `rg`'s lexical match.

### Added — Persistent content-hash embedding cache

**What:** new `EmbedCache` (SQLite-backed) and `CachedEmbedder`
wrapper. Every chunk's UTF-8 SHA-256 + the embedding model id become
the cache key. The wrapper hashes inputs, fetches cached hits in one
`SELECT … WHERE chunk_hash IN (…)`, sends only the miss list to
the inner backend, writes new vectors back, reassembles in input
order. Lives in `$DATA_DIR/embed_cache.sqlite`; shared across
projects (content hashes are content-only). Disable via
`EMBED_CACHE_DISABLED=1`.

**Reason:** on a stable monorepo, ~95% of chunks are unchanged from
one ingest to the next. The cache lets daily re-ingest collapse to
a SQLite scan + Qdrant upsert. Measured on this repo: 55.7 s cold
→ **2.9 s warm = 19× faster** on re-ingest, full features and
identical answers.

### Added — TEI (`text-embeddings-inference`) embedding backend

**What:** new `TEIEmbedder` class + `EMBED_BACKEND=tei` /
`TEI_URL` config. The optional Docker compose profile
`docker compose --profile tei up -d` launches a TEI container
alongside FalkorDB and Qdrant. Cache key is shared with Ollama
when both serve the same model, so switching backends doesn't
re-embed.

**Reason:** on Linux + NVIDIA, TEI serves `bge-m3` at 5-10× the
throughput of Ollama via proper CUDA batching + streaming.
Cold-ingest of a 17k-file monorepo drops from ~2 h (Ollama on Mac
Metal) to ~15-25 min (TEI on Linux). Same `bge-m3` weights, zero
recall change. The Mac CPU image works as a smoke test but offers
no advantage over Ollama's Metal path.

### Added — `--no-vectors` ingest flag

**What:** `code-memory ingest --no-vectors` skips the embedder and
Qdrant entirely, building only the symbol graph. `callers` /
`definitions` / `importers` answer identically; semantic `retrieve`
returns empty.

**Reason:** documented as a niche option for agents that only
consume the graph layer — not a recommendation. The cache above
solves the slow-ingest problem with full features; this flag is
for the genuinely-no-semantic-recall use case.

### Performance — UNWIND-batched Falkor upserts

**What:** `FalkorStore.upsert_nodes` / `upsert_edges` previously
ran one `MERGE` query per node / edge. A file with 50 symbols +
imports + calls hit Falkor 50 times. Now they group by label
(nodes) and `(src_label, type, dst_label)` (edges) and ship one
`UNWIND $rows` per group: ~50 round-trips → ~3 per file.

**Reason:** ~10× faster graph layer, especially on import-heavy
languages. Temporal stamping preserved bit-for-bit.

### Performance — Cross-file embedding batches + pipelined Qdrant

**What:** `_ingest_full` now buffers chunks across files and
flushes to the embedder in batches of 64 (per-file Ollama HTTP
overhead was ~75 ms each before). Qdrant upserts run on a bounded
2-worker thread pool so upload of batch N overlaps with embed of
batch N+1.

**Reason:** per-file HTTP overhead was the second-biggest cost
after model inference. Modest on Mac (Ollama serialises on GPU);
meaningful on Linux + NVIDIA where the embedder is faster than
the qdrant network path.

### Added — Auto-resolved `embed_dim` from model name

**What:** new `_KNOWN_MODEL_DIMS` table in `config.py` and
`resolve_embed_dim(model_name, override)` helper. `Config.embed_dim`
defaults to `0` (sentinel for "auto"); `QdrantStore.__init__`
resolves the actual dim from the model name unless `EMBED_DIM=<n>`
is set explicitly.

**Reason:** swapping `EMBED_MODEL` without setting `EMBED_DIM`
silently truncated or rejected upserts. The known-model table
covers bge, mxbai, and snowflake-arctic at standard sizes;
unknown models default to 1024 with a stderr warning.

### Docs — README headline + framing pass

**What:** the README leads with the verified topology benchmark
table (this repo, Python files, `FalkorStore`): code-memory beats
`rg` on precision (6 true importers vs rg's 7 with 1 false
positive) while returning 5-30× less context for the agent to read
back. The Performance & scale section documents the three real
unlock paths (snapshots, cache, TEI) and an explicit "Honest
limits today" subsection naming what isn't and won't be on the
roadmap.

Earlier "47× faster!" framing tied to `--no-vectors` was walked
back as misleading. Nomic-embed-text was evaluated against
`bge-m3` on a real corpus, lost 42% Recall@10, and removed from
recommendations.

### Removed — Private app names from current tree and full git history

**What:** scrubbed `gc.net`, `gc.webapp`, `isagri`,
`GC.BillingChain`, `IDocumentServiceBase` and related variants
from docs, scripts, tests, and the `BENCHMARK_VS_BASELINE.json`
(443 path leaks). Ran `git filter-repo` to rewrite all 53 commits
of history; force-pushed `main`.

**Reason:** the names belong to private professional projects of
the author's. Anyone with an existing clone needs to delete and
re-clone — SHAs are orphaned. The backup branch
`main-backup-pre-scrub-20260525-142651` is kept locally as a
safety net.

### Added — Claim entity resolution + retrieve-pack surfacing + OpenCode parity

**What:** three follow-ups to the Graphiti-style claim layer:

- `claims/resolver.py` — `EntityResolver` embeds each claim's subject
  and object via the project's Ollama embedder, searches a new
  per-project Qdrant collection `claim_entities__<slug>`, and reuses
  the top hit when cosine ≥ `CLAIMS_ENTITY_THRESHOLD` (default `0.85`).
  Reused entities accumulate surface forms in a payload `aliases` list;
  unmatched ones mint a fresh UUID. Two new nullable columns on the
  `claims` table (`entity_subject_id`, `entity_object_id`) are added
  via idempotent migrations — old DBs upgrade in place.
- `Retriever.retrieve` now pulls top-K claims by query-token overlap
  with mild recency decay (30-day half-life) and surfaces them inside
  the `ContextPack`. The pack's `render()` / `to_dict()` outputs gain a
  `claims` section; the Claude Code and OpenCode plugins both render
  the new section in their auto-injected Context Pack. No-ops cleanly
  when the project has no `claims.db`.
- OpenCode plugin: `extractClaimsDetached` on the `MemoryClient`
  interface, wired into the existing `session.idle` event so claim
  extraction parity with the Claude Code plugin is automatic. `ClaimHit`
  type added to `code-memory-lib/memory-client.ts`.

**Reason:** without resolution, two surface forms of the same entity
("Postgres", "postgres", "Postgres DB") would create three rows that
look independent — contradiction handling and downstream aggregation
would silently miss the connection. Qdrant + Ollama are already in the
stack; reusing them keeps the infra footprint flat. Surfacing claims
in retrieve packs closes the read loop: facts you've told the agent
once now resurface automatically in the next relevant turn, without
the agent having to know they exist. The OpenCode mirror just keeps
the two plugins in lockstep so behavior doesn't diverge by host.

15 new tests cover resolver thresholds, alias accumulation, embedder /
Qdrant failure fallback, and claim ranking + surfacing in the
ContextPack.

### Added — Graphiti-style user-claim extraction

**What:** a new `src/code_memory/claims/` subpackage that turns
substantive user prompts into structured `(subject, predicate, object)`
claims with bi-temporal validity (`valid_at`, `valid_to`,
`recorded_at`, `head_sha`). Pieces:

- `claims.extractor.ClaimExtractor` — thin Ollama `/api/chat` client
  with JSON-schema-constrained output (default model `gemma2:9b`),
  literal-substring `evidence_span` anti-hallucination guard,
  configurable `min_confidence` filter, and case-insensitive dedup.
- `claims.store.ClaimsStore` — SQLite store mirroring the episodic
  store's idempotent-migration pattern. Single-valued predicate
  registry (`uses`, `prefers`, `deployed-to`, `owns`, `is-located-at`,
  `is-a`, `assigned-to`, `depends-on`) auto-closes prior conflicting
  assertions on upsert. Read paths: `current()`, `as_of(when)`,
  `by_id()`.
- New CLI subcommand `code-memory extract-claims --prompt "..."` plus
  detached `extractClaimsDetached` helper in the Claude Code plugin so
  the Stop hook fires extraction without blocking session end.
- New MCP tools `codememory_extract_claims` and `codememory_claims` so
  agents (and the OpenCode plugin) can drive extraction and read claims
  through the same surface as everything else.
- `Config` now carries `claims_enabled`, `claims_llm_model`,
  `claims_llm_timeout`, `claims_min_confidence`, and a per-project
  `claims_db` path under `data/<slug>/claims.db`.
- `scripts/install.sh` gains a `--with-claims` flag and an interactive
  prompt to pull `gemma2:9b` (~5.4 GB) alongside `bge-m3`.

**Reason:** episodes store the whole prompt as opaque text, which means
"what did the user say about X last Tuesday?" requires re-reading every
prompt. Graphiti showed that a bi-temporal claim graph closes that gap
cheaply. Three constraints kept us from copy-pasting their stack:

1. **No cloud LLM.** We already require Ollama for embeddings — adding
   a chat model on the same daemon is one `ollama pull` away. Local
   keeps prompts off the network.
2. **No new database.** SQLite is already in the stack for episodes;
   bi-temporal columns are just four extra fields. The graph store
   (FalkorDB) stays focused on code topology.
3. **No latency budget on the hot path.** Extraction is detached from
   the on-stop hook and only runs when `CLAIMS_EXTRACTION=true`, so a
   default install never pays the inference cost.

Disabled by default. Opt in with `CLAIMS_EXTRACTION=true` after
`ollama pull gemma2:9b`.

### Fixed — Pipeline now actually writes temporal stamps

**What:** every call site in `orchestrator/pipeline.py` that touches
`upsert_nodes` / `upsert_edges` / `delete_file` now forwards
`head_sha` and `head_ord`. A new module-level `_resolve_head(root)`
resolves the git HEAD + first-parent ordinal once per ingest and
threads them through `_ingest_full`, `_ingest_delta`, `ingest_file`,
`reingest_file`, `_upsert_graph`, and all four `_index_*` helpers
(csproj projects, referenced assemblies, file containment, .sln
solutions). `reingest_file` auto-resolves head from the file's
enclosing repo when the caller (e.g. a save-file hook) doesn't
supply one.

**Reason:** the storage-layer temporal work shipped in a separate
slice and the pipeline integration regressed during the .NET trust
pass merge — the `head_sha=` kwarg got dropped from every upsert
call site. `FalkorStore.upsert_nodes` treats `head_sha=None` as
"skip stamping" (intentional legacy fallback), so every ingest
silently wrote zero `first_seen_sha` / `last_seen_sha` values. The
`at_sha` / `drift` / `callers_at_sha` MCP tools queried a graph that
had no temporal data to query and returned empty by design.

Verified empirically: a freshly ingested project on the fixed
pipeline now writes stamps on every File, Symbol, CALLS, IMPORTS,
DEFINES, CONTAINED_IN, USES_ASSEMBLY, EXPOSES_TYPE, MEMBER_OF, and
INJECTS edge.

**Reason for the auto-resolve in `reingest_file`:** the Claude Code
/ OpenCode plugins fire `code-memory reingest <path>` per save hook
without computing the SHA themselves. A single `git rev-parse HEAD`
per hook call is cheap enough that requiring callers to pass it
would just produce empty stamps in practice. Non-git directories
fall through cleanly (`(None, None)`) and keep the legacy unstamped
path.

### Added — .NET production-grade trust pass

**What:** four layers built on top of the basic .NET language
support, in order of dependency:

1. **Ingest-time sanity check.** Every plain-identifier Symbol's
   snippet must contain its own name as a whole word
   (`extractor/sanity.py`). The check uses regex word-boundary
   matching, not bare substring, so a truncated `mmandeRules` no
   longer slips through inside a real `CommandeRules` snippet.
   Failure rate lands on `IngestStats.sanity` with sample
   violations; rates above 2% append a loud `notes` entry so the
   ingest stops being silently wrong.

2. **Partial class merge.** `partial class` / `struct` / `interface`
   / `record` across N files now collapse to a single graph node
   keyed `partial::{namespace}.{Name}` with N `DEFINES` edges from
   each contributing file. Detection covers block-scoped and C# 10
   file-scoped namespaces.

3. **Project topology** — `extractor/csproj.py` parses SDK-style
   and legacy `.csproj` / `.fsproj` / `.vbproj`. Pipeline emits
   `Project` nodes, `PROJECT_REFERENCES` (Project → Project), and
   `PACKAGE_REFERENCES` (Project → Package). Unparseable XML and
   refs pointing outside the repo are dropped — no dead nodes.

4. **Assembly metadata** — `extractor/dll.py` (pure-Python via
   `dnfile`, no .NET runtime needed) reads PE/CLR metadata. Pipeline
   resolves `<PackageReference>` against the NuGet global cache via
   `extractor/nuget.py` (TFM fallback chain net8.0 → net6.0 →
   netstandard2.1 → …) plus project `bin/{config}/{tfm}` outputs,
   and emits `Assembly` + public `Type` nodes with `USES_ASSEMBLY`
   (Project → Assembly) and `EXPOSES_TYPE` (Assembly → Type) edges.

5. **File → Project containment.** Every .NET source file gets a
   `CONTAINED_IN` edge to the deepest `.csproj` whose directory
   prefixes the file path. Files outside any csproj stay unowned
   rather than getting misattributed.

6. **Cross-assembly call resolution.** The resolver gained a fifth
   tier: a call name whose owning project references an `Assembly`
   that uniquely exposes a `Type` with that name becomes a resolved
   `(:File)-[:CALLS]->(:Type)` edge with `confidence="external"`
   and a `via_assembly` property. Ambiguous matches (multiple
   referenced assemblies exposing the same name) stay unresolved by
   design — no coin-flipping.

7. **Solution grouping.** `extractor/sln.py` parses `.sln` files
   (SDK-era + legacy with xmlns). Pipeline emits `Solution` nodes
   and `MEMBER_OF` edges (Project → Solution). Solution-folder
   pseudo-entries (type GUID `2150E333…`) are dropped.

8. **Razor `@inject` DI graph.** `.razor` / `.cshtml` `@inject`
   directives emit `INJECTS` edges from the view file to the
   injected interface or class. The resolver runs the same four-tier
   resolution on `INJECTS` as it does on `CALLS`, so an
   `@inject IUserService` in a Razor view resolves to either the
   in-project interface or a `Type` from a referenced assembly.

9. **Member-level DLL access on demand.** New MCP tool
   `codememory_assembly_members(type, project, assembly?)` reads
   public methods (with parameter counts) directly from the DLL at
   query time. Members aren't bulk-indexed because a single NuGet
   package can expose 10k+ members; on-demand keeps the graph small
   while still answering "what's on this type" for overload
   disambiguation.

10. **Overload disambiguation by call-site arity.** `Symbol` gains
    `param_count`; every `CALLS` edge carries an `args` arity. The
    resolver's project-unique and imported tiers gained an arity
    tiebreak — when N candidates share a name, pick the one whose
    `params` matches the call's `args`. Mismatch or tie stays
    ambiguous.

**Reason:** before this pass, the .NET grade was a generous C on
core features and F on cross-assembly resolution / DI / solution
grouping / member access / overloads. A coding agent asking "who
calls `JsonConvert.SerializeObject`" got nothing because the call
landed on an orphan placeholder. After this pass, the graph
answers cross-assembly with attribution, .NET 10's file-scoped
namespaces parse cleanly, partial classes show as one logical
entity, and the agent can list type members without ballooning
graph size.

### Fixed — UTF-8 byte/char offset chop in tree-sitter slicing

**What:** `extractor/treesitter.py` now reads source as bytes,
strips a UTF-8 BOM if present, parses bytes through tree-sitter,
slices bytes via `_slice(source: bytes, node)`, and decodes UTF-8
only at the very end. Every helper (`_symbol_name`, `_callee_name`,
`_import_module`, `_first_identifier_deep`) takes bytes.

**Reason:** the old code passed bytes to tree-sitter but indexed a
Python `str` with the byte offsets tree-sitter returned. For any
file with non-ASCII content above a symbol (French comments,
identifiers with accents, German Python docstrings) the offsets
drift once and stay drifted — every subsequent identifier was
chopped from the front. Real example caught on a French C# repo:
`class_declaration -> "mmandeRules<T"` instead of `CommandeRules`,
`imports -> "stem;\\n"` instead of `System`, every callee truncated
to a noise prefix. The graph stored those garbled names, so
queries for `CommandeRules` or `DocumentService.Sauver` returned
nothing.

Symptom severity scaled with the volume of non-ASCII content above
each symbol; English codebases sometimes appeared fine for hundreds
of symbols before failing on the first file with an accented
comment. The bug was invisible until someone tried to use the graph.

### Added — BGE-M3 hybrid embed backend (opt-in)

**What:** `code_memory.embed` now supports two backends behind a
shared `HybridVec` (dense + sparse) shape:

- **Ollama** (default) — dense-only via the Ollama daemon. Stays
  warm across short-lived processes (per-save reingest hooks, git
  hooks) so cold-load doesn't tax the user.
- **FlagEmbedding** (`EMBED_BACKEND=flagembed`, requires
  `[hybrid]` extra) — in-process BGE-M3 producing dense + sparse
  from one forward pass. Heavy (~2.3 GB weights, ~5-15 s cold load)
  but enables true hybrid retrieval.

`QdrantStore` collections use named-vector layout (`dense` +
`sparse` slots) with IDF modifier on the sparse side, so flipping
between backends doesn't require schema changes. Search supports
`mode={dense, hybrid, hybrid_dbsf}`; hybrid falls through to dense
when the query vector has no sparse component (Ollama path).

Hybrid retrieval is **opt-in** via `CODEMEMORY_HYBRID=1`. Benchmarks
on a 2.6k-file Angular corpus showed pure dense outperforming
hybrid (RRF and DBSF) on natural-language queries — m3's dense
head is strong enough that adding sparse tends to surface
generated API stubs and `.spec.ts` files that share identifier
vocabulary with the query without bringing new wins. The opt-in
exists for symbol-heavy corpora; re-run `scripts/benchmark.py`
before flipping.

**Reason:** Ollama by default keeps per-file save-hook reingests
viable — the alternative (in-process model load per CLI
invocation) added 5-15 s startup to every Write/Edit. Keeping the
collection layout hybrid-ready means users can later opt in to the
sparse signal without re-ingesting.

### Added — Retrieval benchmark harness

**What:** `scripts/benchmark.py` runs a fixed query set through six
modes (dense, hybrid RRF, hybrid DBSF, each with and without
cross-encoder rerank) against a populated Qdrant collection and
reports Recall@5 / Recall@10 / MRR / nDCG@10 / p50 / p95 latency.
Output is markdown (`docs/BENCHMARK.md`) + raw JSON
(`docs/benchmark-raw.json`). 30 hand-crafted gold queries against
a sample Angular corpus ship as a baseline.

**Reason:** retrieval-quality regressions were invisible until an
agent complained. A reproducible benchmark lets future model /
chunk-text / fusion changes be evaluated against the same gold set
before they ship.

### Added — Topological SHA ordinals + time-travel queries

**What:** every temporal stamp (`first_seen_sha`, `last_seen_sha`,
`invalid_sha`) now has a matching integer companion
(`first_seen_ord`, `last_seen_ord`, `invalid_ord`) sourced from
`git rev-list --count --first-parent <sha>`. Tombstone writes also
record an `invalid_at` wall-clock timestamp.

Two new `FalkorStore` methods read this:

- `at_sha(sha, sha_ord, label="Symbol")` — returns nodes that were
  alive at a given commit. "Alive" = `first_seen_ord <= sha_ord` AND
  (`invalid_ord IS NULL` OR `invalid_ord > sha_ord`).
- `callers_at_sha(symbol, sha, sha_ord)` — callers of a symbol as the
  graph looked at that commit. Tombstoned callers whose `invalid_ord >
  sha_ord` count as alive.

**Reason:** plain SHA strings can't be range-queried — `'abc123' <=
'def456'` is meaningless graph topology. The first-parent ordinal gives
a monotonic integer along the main branch (parent < child, always)
which makes "graph as of last week" answerable in one Cypher query
without resolving topology on the fly.

**Reason it's first-parent only:** merge commits otherwise inflate the
ordinal in ways that depend on which side of the merge a fact came
from. First-parent count tracks the *trunk* timeline, which is what
"before / after release N" usually means.

**Compatibility:** rows ingested before this slice carry no ordinal.
`at_sha` filters them out (`first_seen_ord IS NOT NULL` guard) — we can
prove a row is alive at SHA X only if we have an ordinal to compare
against. After one ingest at the post-upgrade HEAD, every touched row
backfills its ordinals via the COALESCE rules in `upsert_nodes` /
`upsert_edges`.

### Added — `code-memory vacuum` and graph tombstone GC

**What:** new CLI command and `FalkorStore.vacuum()` method that drop
tombstoned graph elements under three mutually exclusive policies:

```bash
code-memory vacuum --before release/26.18   # drop tombstones whose
                                            # invalid_ord <= ord(release/26.18)
code-memory vacuum --older-than 30d         # drop tombstones older than 30 days
code-memory vacuum --all                    # drop every tombstone
code-memory vacuum --before main --dry-run  # report counts without writing
```

Returns `{"files": N, "symbols": N, "edges": N}` of items affected.

**Reason:** the temporal model is monotonic-add-only by design (delete
is replaced by tombstone). Without vacuum, the graph grows forever.
Three policies because three workflows want different things:

- `--before` for "this release is shipped, I don't care about its
  pre-release history" — exact, reproducible, scriptable.
- `--older-than` for "I just want to bound storage, don't care which
  commit" — works in repos with no clean release pattern.
- `--all` for "nuke history, start fresh on tombstones" — useful after
  large refactors or schema migrations.

**Reason it's a separate command, not auto-run:** vacuuming is
destructive. Once a tombstone is gone, the time-travel and pre-deletion
queries that motivated the temporal model in the first place stop
working for that range. Making it explicit forces a deliberate decision.

### Added — MCP tools `codememory_drift`, `codememory_at_sha`, `codememory_callers_at_sha`

**What:** three new MCP tool surfaces wrap the temporal queries so a
coding agent can ask them directly:

- `codememory_drift(head_sha, project)` — symbols not last-seen at
  `head_sha`. Returns `tombstoned` vs `drifted` classification.
- `codememory_at_sha(sha, sha_ord, label?, limit?, project)` —
  generic "alive at this commit" query. `label` switches between
  Symbol (default) and File. Callers compute `sha_ord` via git on
  their side (we don't want the MCP server shelling out per call).
- `codememory_callers_at_sha(symbol, sha, sha_ord, project)` —
  callers as of a specific commit.

**Reason:** these queries are useless if only humans on the CLI can
reach them. Coding agents — Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor — talk to
code-memory through MCP. Without these tools, the agent's path to
"what called X before commit Y removed it" is "shell out, checkout,
re-ingest, query, restore" — which it can't safely do. Native MCP
makes the time-travel queries first-class.

**Reason the caller passes `sha_ord` instead of having us resolve it:**
the MCP server may not have git available (sandboxed containers, MCP
running on a different host than the repo). The agent already has the
repo open and can call `git rev-list --count --first-parent <sha>`
cheaply; making it part of the input keeps the server pure.

### Added — Temporal model for the code graph

**What:** every File / Symbol / edge in the FalkorDB graph now carries
three SHA-keyed lifecycle properties:

| property | meaning |
|---|---|
| `first_seen_sha` | git HEAD at the first ingest that saw this element |
| `last_seen_sha` | git HEAD at the most recent ingest that confirmed it still exists |
| `invalid_sha` | git HEAD at the ingest that *removed* it (tombstone marker) |

**Behaviour change:** `delete_file()` no longer issues `DETACH DELETE`
when called from a git-aware ingest. Instead it stamps `invalid_sha` on
the File node, on every Symbol the file defines (excluding shared
`name::X` placeholders), and on every edge touching the File. The data
stays in the graph as a tombstone; topology queries filter it out by
default via a `WHERE invalid_sha IS NULL` predicate.

**Reason:** three concrete problems that pure HEAD-only graphs couldn't
answer cheaply:

1. *"This symbol got deleted in commit X — what used to call it?"*
   Pre-change: hard delete erased the answer. Re-ingesting at the
   parent SHA into a side project took 2+ hours on real codebases.
   Post-change: the symbol stays as a tombstone with `invalid_sha = X`,
   and `(caller)-[:CALLS]->(s)` with the tombstone filter relaxed
   answers in milliseconds.
2. *Drift detection.* "Is this comment / reference still accurate at
   HEAD?" Now answerable in one Cypher query: `MATCH (s:Symbol) WHERE
   s.last_seen_sha <> $head` returns everything the most recent ingest
   didn't confirm.
3. *Episode replay.* Each agent episode now stores the git HEAD it was
   reasoning over (see below). Combined with first/last SHA on graph
   elements, the graph state at episode time becomes
   reconstructable without rewinding the working tree.

**Migration:** legacy graphs (no temporal fields) keep working. The
upsert cypher uses `COALESCE(first_seen_sha, $head)` so the first
post-upgrade ingest backfills `first_seen_sha = last_seen_sha = current
HEAD` for every node it touches. The `WHERE invalid_sha IS NULL`
predicate is a no-op when the property is absent.

**Cost:** ~80 bytes of extra props per node + per edge. For the largest
indexed corpus (~200k symbols) that's ~16 MB. Storage grows monotonically
because tombstones aren't garbage-collected — a `code-memory vacuum
--before <sha>` command is on the roadmap.

**Not done in this slice:**
- No topological ordering on SHAs yet (would require `git rev-list
  --count` at ingest). Means "graph as of SHA X" queries still need an
  exact SHA, not a "before T" range.
- Edge-version tracking is coarse: an edge that disappears and reappears
  later collapses into one row whose `last_seen_sha` jumps over the gap.
  Fine for the use cases above; not enough for "show me every commit
  that toggled this call edge".

### Added — `Episode.head_sha`

**What:** the episodic store now persists the git HEAD active at the
moment the episode was recorded. New column on the SQLite `episodes`
table, idempotent ALTER migration for legacy databases.

**Reason:** without this field, episodes were timestamped wall-clock
floats with no link back to the code state the agent was reasoning
about. With it, episode replay can ask "what did the graph look like
when this patch was written?" by intersecting the episode's `head_sha`
with the new temporal stamps on graph elements.

**Reason it's optional / nullable:** non-git ingests still record
episodes; they just leave the field NULL. Legacy episodes recorded
before the migration also stay NULL, which means "unknown SHA" — not
"SHA was the empty string".

### Added — `FalkorStore.drift(head_sha)`

**What:** returns the list of Symbols whose `last_seen_sha` doesn't
match the supplied HEAD, classified as `tombstoned` (deleted) or
`drifted` (a prior incremental ingest missed it or it moved).

**Reason:** quickest possible answer to "did this codebase change in
ways my last incremental ingest didn't catch?" Useful for sanity-checking
a watcher that's been running for days and for finding stale references
in comments / docs.

### Anonymized internal corpus references

**What:** scrubbed private corporate identifiers (org name, internal
product slugs, absolute home-directory paths) out of `README.md`,
benchmark docs and JSON, plugin SKILL.md files, source comments, and
test fixtures. Replaced with neutral placeholders.

**Reason:** this repository is public. Original benchmark data mentioned
a private corporate codebase; leaving the names in would leak
employer-owned naming.

**Note for maintainers:** git history still contains the originals.
Anyone considering a clean-history rewrite (e.g. `git filter-repo`)
should treat this entry as the motivation.

### Added — Watch-root safety guard

**What:** `code-memory watch <path>` and the autostart bootstrap now
refuse to attach to filesystem roots, `$HOME`, `/tmp`, `/var`, `/etc`,
`/usr`, `/System`, `/Library`, `/opt`, `/Applications`, `C:/`,
`C:/Users`, `C:/Windows`, and `C:/Program Files`. The watcher emits
`error: refusing to watch …` and exits 2; the autostart adapter returns
a synthetic `<unsafe-root>` status without installing the unit.

**Reason:** a rogue `code-memory watch $HOME` had pinned 206% CPU and
accumulated 39 wall-hours of work walking every Node / IDE / browser
cache on disk. The launchd plist that registered it ran with
`KeepAlive=true` so `kill` alone wouldn't stop it. The guard makes the
configuration error impossible to commit by accident.

### Added — Ingest progress heartbeat

**What:** during `code-memory ingest` (full or incremental), a
`[code-memory] full ingest: files=N symbols=… chunks=… rate=X/s` line
goes to **stderr** every 50 files (configurable via
`CODEMEMORY_PROGRESS_EVERY`, disable with `CODEMEMORY_PROGRESS=0`).
Stdout / `--json` output is unchanged.

**Reason:** large ingests (133K chunks against bge-m3 via Ollama)
take 2+ hours, and the CLI used to print nothing until the very end.
Users assumed the process had hung and killed it, losing all in-progress
work. The heartbeat is the cheapest possible "yes it's still running"
signal that doesn't pollute the JSON contract.

### Added — .NET ecosystem language support

**What:** the tree-sitter extractor now recognises:

- `.cs` (C#)
- `.razor`, `.cshtml` (Razor — embeds C# inside HTML)
- `.vb` (VB.NET)
- `.fs`, `.fsi`, `.fsx` (F#)

For each, the symbol / import / call node-type set is extended so
classes, methods, properties, namespaces, modules, `using` / `Imports` /
`open` directives, and method invocations are correctly extracted. F#
call edges are intentionally skipped: `application_expression` is too
recursive to produce useful graph edges (`x + y` would parse as a call
to `op_Addition`). Default-ignored directories now include `bin`, `obj`,
`packages`, `TestResults`, `.vs`, `artifacts`.

**Reason:** the project previously parsed only TS / JS / Python. Real
mixed-stack repositories (Angular front + .NET back) had a blind spot
that ranked retrieval purely on dense vector similarity without graph
topology for half the codebase. With this, callers / callees /
definitions all work across the .NET half — except for the cross-file
resolver, which still doesn't understand C# namespaces (it only
handles relative imports). That gap is tracked as a follow-up.
