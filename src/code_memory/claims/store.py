"""SQLite store for extracted user claims with bi-temporal validity.

Schema mirrors the ``episodes`` table's idempotent-migration pattern.
Each claim row carries:

  * ``valid_at``    — when the user asserted it (prompt timestamp)
  * ``valid_to``    — when the assertion was superseded (NULL = current)
  * ``recorded_at`` — when we ingested it (system clock)
  * ``head_sha``    — git HEAD at extraction time

The combination gives bi-temporal queries: "as of commit X, what did the
user say about Y?" and "what was the user's stated preference for Y at
time T according to what we knew at time T'?".

Contradiction handling: predicates listed in :data:`SINGLE_VALUED_PREDICATES`
are treated as functional — at most one open ``(subject, predicate)`` per
session. Upserting a new ``(s, p, o2)`` closes the prior ``(s, p, o1)`` by
setting its ``valid_to = new.valid_at``.

Multi-valued predicates (e.g. ``mentioned``, ``worked-on``) coexist
without conflict.

        Dedupe: an open row with the same (subject, predicate, object,

        ``now``, its ``confidence`` becomes ``max(prev, new)``, and a
        non-empty new ``evidence_span`` overwrites a missing/equal one.
        This prevents bloat when the agent re-asserts the same claim
        across turns or sessions (which happens often with the
        "ACT BEFORE ANSWERING" nudge in the plugins).

        For single-valued predicates: any open ``(subject, predicate)``
        row with a different ``object`` gets ``valid_to`` set to the
        new claim's ``valid_at``. Polarity flips also close.

        (the Qdrant claim vector store) need both: insert/refresh the
        canonical id, and flip ``open=false`` on the closed ids.
